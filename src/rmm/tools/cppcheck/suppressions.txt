// Cppcheck includes its own system headers so we do not ask it to search for
// our own (freestanding headers are provided by the compiler, and anything else
// is provided by the `rmm-lib-libc` target).
missingIncludeSystem

// Cppcheck reports a lot of false positives for unused functions, as it cannot
// analyze the SMC call boundary. Short of manually suppressing half of the
// code-base, there's not much we can do about this.
unusedFunction

// Because files are analyzed individually, Cppcheck sometimes complains that
// the `missingIncludeSystem` suppression was useless. It's right, but it's
// also not particularly helpful.
unmatchedSuppression

// We don't want to receive warnings about code we don't control, which includes
// any external libraries we vendor.
